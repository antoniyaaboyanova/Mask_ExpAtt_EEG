👋 WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING PART IN THIS EXPERIMENT👋

In this task, you will see a series of very brief images
presented on the left and right side of the screen 👀

Each trial begins with a word cue shown at the center
of the screen 

The cue indicates the type of image that is MORE LIKELY
to appear on that trial — but it is NOT always correct 🤔

The cues you will see are:

▶  Sea animal
▶  Water vessel
▶  Neutral

After the cue, two images will appear very briefly:
one on the left and one on the right 
They will be immediately followed by visual masks ⏱

⚠ IMPORTANT ⚠
Please keep your eyes on the + fixation cross
at the center of the screen at all times 🎯

Press SPACE to continue ⌨
